Pacman Notes

August 15th 2020 | K.T.
    Map is nice and unique, scoreboard works
        Could add audio and arcade pacman music in the future?

    Successfully animated pacman mouth
        Needs to learn how to face North, West, and South and not constantly East depending on what arrow key is pressed...
    
    Ghost is hard to animate
        Need to make eyes/pupils
        Need to make the ghost skirt 

    Investigate power pellet 
        Can kill one ghost, second ghost that is afraid is not eaten when Pac-man reaches it?...
        Bit Slow to kill second ghost

    ***ALGORITHM
    Need to improve ghost algorithm 
        (1) Scatter: run away from pac-man for short period of time to a specific corner in the map
        (2) Chase: chase pac-man for a good deal of time
            //Blinky is perfect by itself. With others, he tends to teleport two tiles forward at a time...
            //ghosts tend to move diagonally...
            //pinky by itself tries to block you when it is facing a certain direction or eat you immediately other times. 
        (3) Region Awareness: one ghost at each corner 
        (4) Can Ghost go through the tunnel?
        (5) Ghost stuck on corners. 

        Blinky: Dijkstra's???

            //SUCCESS!!!
            //index on the board are nodes 
            //each index is adjacent to one another so weight=1
            //apply the dijkstra's algorithm to the map

        Need to fix function nodeWeightFinderAllDirections(nodeSource) 
            //fixed: just needed to do left and up correctly
            //right and bottom is redundant
