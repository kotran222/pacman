Pacman Notes

August 15th 2020 | K.T.
    Map is nice and unique, scoreboard works
        Could add audio and arcade pacman music in the future?

    Successfully animated pacman mouth
        Needs to learn how to face North, West, and South and not constantly East depending on what arrow key is pressed...
    
    Ghost is hard to animate
        Need to make eyes/pupils
        Need to make the ghost skirt 

    Investigate power pellet 
        Can kill one ghost, second ghost that is afraid is not eaten when Pac-man reaches it?...
        Bit Slow to kill second ghost

    ***ALGORITHM
    Need to improve ghost algorithm 
        (1) Scatter: run away from pac-man for short period of time to a specific corner in the map
            //activateScatterMode alone works well    
        (2) Chase: chase pac-man for a good deal of time
            //activateChaseMode alone works well
            //Blinky can chase you
            //pinky by itself tries to block you when it is facing a certain direction or eat you immediately other times. 
            //inky patrols randomly selected walkable tiles on the map
            //clyde wanders randomly
        (3) Region Awareness: one ghost at each corner 
            //travel to their corner works. scatter afterwards work
        (4) Can Ghost go through the tunnel?
            //No
        (5) Ghost stuck on corners. 
            //fixed

        Blinky: Dijkstra's???
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXzkppr6TVs
            //SUCCESS!!!
            //index on the board are nodes 
            //each index is adjacent to one another so weight=1
            //apply the dijkstra's algorithm to the map

        Need to fix function nodeWeightFinderAllDirections(nodeSource) 
            //fixed: just needed to do left and up correctly
            //right and bottom is redundant

    Updates
    All ghosts chase and scatter modes are done. 
    challenge: using setInterval to alternate between scatter and chase modes. 
        problem: the ghosts movements themselves utilize setInterval 
                put them under the umbrella function moveGhost which also uses setInterval causes crazy glitches
        solution so far: when a certain score is reached within the individual ghost movement functions, clearInterval is called so ghost can freeze in their tracks and the setInterval overlap won't occur to cause further glitches. THIS IS REQUIRED if you want to alternate between the scatter, random, or chase modes of each ghost.
                        the setInterval within the moveGhost is a larger interval so player has enough time to collect points to avoid glitches
                        in the last round, chaseMode is locked and setInterval in moveGhost is deactivated.
        Needed improvements:  moveGhost setInterval is bad when player can quickly collect points so relying on time is a challenge --> ghosts stop moving and can't transition to next round until setInterval goes to next loop
                                decreasing the moveGhost setInterval to a lower time causes ghosts to glitch when player didn't collect enough points to stop the overlaps
